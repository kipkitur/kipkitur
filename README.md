### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I am QA Tester and a certified AWS solutions architect associate looking to ensure that systems deliver __value__ for the intended audience/end users. It is important that users are able to interact with bug free and high quality software. I have a passion for learning and sharing knowledge with others. You can reach me on twitter at [kip_arap_](https://twitter.com/kip_arap_) or [email](kemeikitur@gmail.com) me.
