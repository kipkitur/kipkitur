**kipkitur/kipkitur** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

<!--Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on automation testing projects with pytest, Cucumber and Postman
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JUnit, unittest, Python and Jenkins 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience in Kenya & China and how it gave me a better outlook of living and working with a multi-cultural team. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was 6 years old, I had one of the best pitch for a cartoon show.
